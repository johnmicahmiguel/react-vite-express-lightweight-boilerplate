# React App Plan: Business Owners & Contractors Platform

A web app combining elements of social media and job marketplaces (like Upwork), with two user roles: Business Owner and Contractor.

- View applicants (approve or reject them)  
- Access my message inbox  

### Contractors / Suppliers / Service Providers

As a contractor, I should be able to:

- Create an account and set up a profile with offered services  
- Log in  
- View business owners’ posts in a feed  
- Comment or apply to posts  
- View ratings and feedback from past services  
- Create my own posts
